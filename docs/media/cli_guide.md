## Amplify CLI  

AWS Amplify connects to AWS Mobile Hub to work with Amazon Web Services. You can use [amplify-cli](https://github.com/aws/amplify-cli) to create a new AWS Mobile Hub project or enable an existing project to work with AWS Mobile Hub. 

```bash
$ npm install -g amplify-cli
```

If it is the first time you are using `amplify-cli`, you need to configure the CLI with your AWS credentials. To setup permissions for the toolchain used by the CLI, run:

```bash
$ amplify configure
```

If prompted for credentials, follow the steps provided by the CLI. For more information, see [Provide IAM credentials to Amplify CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/aws-mobile-cli-credentials.html).
